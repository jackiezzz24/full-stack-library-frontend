# Full Stack Library Management Application - Front End

+	Designed a Full Stack library management application enabling users to search books by title and category, checkout and give star reviews. Administers can manage book information, receive, and reply to messages.  
+	Assembled interactive functions and callbacks with React and TypeScript in frontend and the backend utilizing Spring Boot and Java.
+	Applied Spring Data JPA for dataâ€™s access layer and leveraged Apache Maven for project management.
+	Aggregate data based on business logic and persisted results into MySQL to support downstream clients.
+	Integrated login/logout features with JWT, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle user roles with limited access.
